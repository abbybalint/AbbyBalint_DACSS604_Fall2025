## Project Example

This  project was from a visualization course. This dashboard reflects ways to visualize the data I analyzed including plots, histograms, and maps. I used data from a survey about jobs in data science to create these visuals. For example, I was able to show how salary ranges for data science jobs vary around the world, or what percentage of jobs were remote vs in person through the years.
